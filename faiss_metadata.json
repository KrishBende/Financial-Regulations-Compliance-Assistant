As the guiding ethical code it is\nprimarily known for its edict to do no harm to the patient. However, the complexities of modern\nmedicine research necessitate a more elaborate set of guidelines that address a Physician’s ethical\nand scientific responsibilities such as obtaining informed consent or disclosing risk while involved\nin biomedical research.\nGood Clinical Practice is a set of guidelines for biomedical studies which encompasses the design,\nconduct, termination, audit, analysis, reporting and documentation of the studies involving human\nsubjects.

The fundamental tenet of GCP is that in research on man, the interest of science and\nsociety should never take precedence over considerations related to the well being of the study\nsubject. It aims to ensure that the studies are scientifically and ethically sound and that the clinical\nproperties of the pharmaceutical substances under investigation are properly documented. The\nguidelines seek to establish two cardinal principles: protection of the rights of human subjects and\nauthenticity of biomedical data generated.\nThese guidelines have been evolved with consideration of WHO, ICH, USFDA and European\nGCP guidelines as well as the Ethical Guidelines for Biomedical research on Human Subjects\nissued by the Indian Council of Medical Research. They should be followed for carrying out all\nbiomedical research in India at all stages of drug development, whether prior or subsequent to\nproduct registration in India.\nDEFINITIONS\nAct\nWherever relevant, the Act means Drugs & Cosmetics Act 1940 (23 of 1940) and the Rules made\nthereunder.\nAdverse Event (AE)\nAny untoward medical occurrence (including a symptom / disease or an abnormal laboratory\nfinding) during treatment with a pharmaceutical product in a patient or a human volunteer that\ndoes not necessarily have a relationship with the treatment being given.

Type A reactions\nrepresent an augmentation of the pharmacological actions of a drug. They are dose-dependent and\nare, therefore, readily reversible on reducing the dose or withdrawing the drug.

The number of Subjects to be included in the study is determined in relation to\nthe statistical model on which the Protocol is based.\n6.2. Study Design:\nThe scientific integrity of a Clinical Study and the credibility of its report depends on the\ndesign of the Study. In comparative studies the Protocol should describe:\n1. an “a priori” rationale for the target difference between treatments that the Study is\nbeing designed to detect, and the power to detect that difference, taking into account\nclinical and scientific information and professional judgment on the clinical\nsignificance of statistical differences.\n2. measures taken to avoid bias, particularly methods of Randomisation.\n6.2.1. Randomisation and blinding:\nThe key idea of a clinical trial is to compare groups of patients who differ only with\nrespect to their treatment. If the groups differ in some other way then the\ncomparison of treatment gets biased. Randomisation, as one of the fundamental\nprinciples of experimental design, it deals with the possible bias at the treatment\nallocation. It ensures that the allocation of treatment to human subjects is\nindependent of their characteristics. Another important benefit of Randomisation is\nthat statistical methods of analysis are based on what we expect to happen in\nrandom samples from populations with specified characteristics. The Protocol must\nstate the method used for Randomisation.\nThe Study should use the maximum degree of blindness that is possible.

Study\nsubjects, investigator or any other party concerned with the study may observe\nand respond by knowledge of which treatment was given. To avoid such bias it is\noften desired that the patient or any other person involved with the study does not\nknow which treatment was given. Where a sealed code for each individual\ntreatment has been assigned in a blinded randomized study it should be kept both\nat the site of the investigation and with the sponsor.\nThe Protocol must state the conditions under which the code is allowed to be broken\nand by whom.

The phase of these trials differ from drug trials\nas given below:\nPhase I: This refers to the first introduction of a vaccine into a human population\nfor determination of its safety and biological effects including immunogenicity.\nThis phase includes study of dose and route of administration and should\ninvolve low risk subjects. For example, immunogenicity to hepatitis vaccine\nshould not be determined in high-risk subjects.\nPhase II: This refers to the initial trials examining effectiveness (immunogenicity)\nin a limited number of volunteers. Vaccines can be prophylactic and therapeutic in\nnature. While prophylactic vaccines are given to normal subjects, therapeutic or\ncurative vaccines may be given to patients suffering from particular disease.\nPhase III: This focuses on assessments of safety and effectiveness in the prevention\nof disease, involving controlled study on a larger number of volunteers (in\nthousands) in multi-centres.\n7.1.2. Guidelines\n· The sponsor and investigator should be aware of the approval process(es)\ninvolved in conducting clinical trials of vaccines. They should familiarize\nthemselves with the guidelines provided by Drug Controller General (India),\nDepartment of Biotechnology (DBT) and Ministry of Environment and Genetic\nEngineering Approval Committee (GEAC) in the case of vaccines produced by\nrecombinant DNA technology.

Several medical devices and critical care equipments\nhave been developed and many more are in various stages of development. However, only\nthrough good manufacturing practices (GMP) can the end products reach the stage of\nutilization by society. Most of these products are only evaluated by Central Excise testing\nfor taxation purposes, which discourages entrepreneurs to venture in this area with quality\nproducts especially when they do not come under the strict purview of the existing\nregulatory bodies like ISI, BSI and Drug Controller General. This is evidenced by the very\nlow number of patents or propriety medical equipments manufactured and produced in the\ncountry. As the capacity of the country in this area is improving day by day the need for a\nregulatory mechanism/ authority is increasingly obvious. The concept of regulations\ngoverning investigations involving biomedical devices is therefore relatively new in India.\nAt present, except for needles and syringes these are not covered by the Drugs and\nCosmetics Act, 1940. The Chief Executive of the Society of Biomedical Technology\n(SBMT) set up under the Defence Research Development Organisation (DRDO) has\ndrafted a proposal for the setting up of a regulatory, tentatively named as the Indian Medical\nDevices Regulatory Authority (IMDRA).

Until the guidelines are formulated and\nimplemented by this regulatory Authority clinical trials with biomedical devices should be\napproved on case to case basis by committees constituted for the specific purpose.\n7.3.1. Definitions:\nMedical devices: A medical device is defined as an inert diagnostic of therapeutic\narticle that does not achieve any of its principal intended purposes through chemical\naction, within or on the body unlike the medicated devices which contain\npharmacologically active substances which are treated as drugs. Such devices\ninclude diagnostic test kits, crutches, electrodes, pacemakers, arterial grafts, intra-\nocular lenses, orthopaedic pins and other orthopaedic accessories.\nDepending upon risks involved the devices could be classified as follows:\na. Non critical devices: An investigational device that does not present\nsignificant risk to the patients’e.g. Thermometer, B.P. apparatus.\nb. Critical devices: An investigational device that presents a potential risk to the\nhealth, safety, welfare of the subject- for example, pacemakers, implants,\ninternal catheters.\nAll the general principles of clinical trials described for clinical trials should also\nbe considered for trials of medical devices. As for the drugs, safety evaluation and\npre-market efficacy of devices for 1-3 years with data on adverse reactions should\nbe obtained before pre-market certification. The duration of the trial and extent of\nuse may be decided in case to case basis by the appropriate authorities.

Guidelines\no Safety data of the medical device in animals should be obtained and likely\nrisks posed by the device should be considered.\no A clinical trial of medical devices is different from drug trials, as former can\nnot be done in healthy volunteers. Hence phase I of drug trial is not necessary\nfor trial on devices.\no Medical devices used within the body may have greater risk potential than\nthose used on or outside the body, for example, orthopaedic pins Vs crutches.\no Medical device not used regularly have less risk potential than those used\nregularly, for example, contact lens Vs intraocular lenses.\no Safety procedures to introduce a medical device in the patient should also be\nfollowed as the procedure itself may cause harm to the patient.\no Informed consent procedures should be followed as in drug trials. The patient\ninformation sheet should contain information on following procedures to be\nadopted if the patient decides to withdraw from the trial.\n7.4. Clinical trials for Diagnostic Agents - Use of Radio-active Materials and X- Rays\nIn human beings, for investigation and treatment, different radiations- X-rays, gamma rays\nand beta rays, radio opaque contrast agents and radioactive materials are used. The relative\nrisks and benefits of research proposal utilizing radioactive materials or X-rays should be\nevaluated.

INTRODUCTION\n1. The World Medical Association has developed the Declaration of Helsinki as a statement\nof ethical principles to provide guidance to physicians and other participants in medical\nresearch involving human subjects. Medical research involving human subjects includes\nresearch on identifiable human material or identifiable data.\n2. It is the duty of the physician to promote and safeguard the health of the people. The\nphysician's knowledge and conscience are dedicated to the fulfilment of this duty.\n3. The Declaration of Geneva of the World Medical Association binds the physician with the\nwords, \"The health of my patient will be my first consideration,\" and the International Code\nof Medical Ethics declares that, \"A physician shall act only in the patient's interest when\nproviding medical care which might have the effect of weakening the physical and mental\ncondition of the patient.\"\n4. Medical progress is based on research, which ultimately must rest in part on\nexperimentation involving human subjects.\n5. In medical research on human subjects, considerations related to the well-being of the\nhuman subject should take precedence over the interests of science and society.\n6. The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve\nprophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology\nand pathogenesis of disease.

The primary purpose of medical research involving human subjects is to improve\nprophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the understanding of the aetiology\nand pathogenesis of disease. Even the best proven prophylactic, diagnostic, and therapeutic\nmethods must continuously be challenged through research for their effectiveness,\nefficiency, accessibility and quality.\n7. In current medical practice and in medical research, most prophylactic, diagnostic and\ntherapeutic procedures involve risks and burdens.\n8. Medical research is subject to ethical standards that promote respect for all human beings\nand protect their health and rights. Some research populations are vulnerable and need\nspecial protection. The particular needs of the economically and medically disadvantaged\nmust be recognised. Special attention is also required for those who cannot give or refuse\nconsent for themselves, for those who may be subject to giving consent under duress, for\nthose who will not benefit personally from the research and for those for whom the\nresearch is combined with care.\n9. Research Investigators should be aware of the ethical, legal and regulatory requirements for\nresearch on human subjects in their own countries as well as applicable international\nrequirements. No national ethical, legal or regulatory requirement should be allowed to\nreduce or eliminate any of the protections for human subjects set forth in this Declaration.\nB.

Medical research involving human subjects should be conducted only by scientifically\nqualified persons and under the supervision of a clinically competent medical person. The\nresponsibility for the human subject must always rest with a medically qualified person\nand never rest on the subject of the research, even though the subject has given consent.\n16. Every medical research project involving human subjects should be preceded by careful\nassessment of predictable risks and burdens in comparison with foreseeable benefits to\nthe subject or to others. This does not preclude the participation of healthy volunteers in\nmedical research. The design of all studies should be publicly available.\n17. Physicians should abstain from engaging in research projects involving human subjects\nunless they are confident that the risks involved have been adequately assessed and can\nbe satisfactorily managed.

When\nmedical research is combined with medical care, additional standards apply to protect the\npatients who are research subjects.\n29.

In the treatment of a patient, where proven prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic\nmethods do not exist or have been ineffective, the physician, with informed consent from\nthe patient, must be free to use unproven or new prophylactic, diagnostic and therapeutic\nmeasures, if in the physician's judgement it offers hope of saving life, re-establishing\nhealth or alleviating suffering. Where possible, these measures should be made the object\nof research, designed to evaluate their safety and efficacy. In all cases, new information\nshould be recorded and, where appropriate, published. The other relevant guidelines of\nthis Declaration should be followed.\nAppendix II:\nSCHEDULE Y\nRequirements and guidelines on clinical trials for import and manufacture of new drug\n1. Clinical Trials\n1. Nature of trials: The clinical trials required to be carried out in the country before\na new drug is approved for marketing depend on the status of the drug in other\ncountries. If the drug is already approved/marketed, phase III trials as required\nunder item 7 of Appendix I (to Sch. Y) usually are required. If the drug is not\napproved/ marketed, trials are generally allowed to be initiated at one phase earlier\nto the phase of trials in other countries.\nFor new drug substances discovered in other countries phase I trials are not usually allowed to be\ninitiated in India unless phase I data as required under Item 5 of the said Appendix from other\ncountries are available. However, such trials may be permitted even in the absence of phase I",

However, such trials may be permitted even in the absence of phase I\ndata from other countries if the drug is of special relevance to the health problem of India.\nFor new drug substances discovered in India, clinical trials are required to be carried out in India\nright from phase I as required from Item 5 of the said Appendix, through phase III as required\nunder Item 7 of the said Appendix, permission to carry out these trials is generally given in\nstages, considering the data emerging from earlier phase.\n2. Permission for trials: Permission to initiate clinical trials with a new drug may be\nobtained by applying in Form 12 for a test license (TL) to import or manufacture\nthe drug under the Rules. Data appropriate for the various phases of clinical trials\nto be carried out should accompany the application as per format given in Appendix\nI (Items I-4). In addition, the protocol for proposed trials, case report forms to be\nused, and the names of investigators and institutions should also be submitted for\napproval. The investigators selected should possess appropriate qualifications and\nexperience and should have such investigational facilities as are germane to the\nproposed trials protocol.\nPermission to carry out clinical trials with a new drug is issued along with a test license in Form\n11.\nIt is desirable that protocols for clinical trials be reviewed and approved by the\ninstitution’s ethical committee.

Since such committees at present do not exist in all\ninstitutions, the approval granted to a protocol by the ethical committee of one institution\nwill be applicable to the use of that protocol in other institutions, which do not have an\nethical committee. In case none of the trial centres/institutions has an ethical committee the\nacceptance of the protocol by the investigator and its approval by the Drugs Controller\n(India) or any officer as authorized by him to do so will be adequate to initiate the trials.\nFor new drugs having potential for use in children, permission for clinical trials in the\npaediatric age group is normally given after phase III trials as required under item 7 of the\nsaid Appendix, in adults are completed. However, if the drug is of value primarily in a\ndisease of children, early trials in the paediatric age group may be allowed.\n3. Responsibilities of Sponsor/Investigator: Sponsors are required to submit to the\nLicensing Authority as given under Rule 21 an annual status report on each clinical\ntrial, namely, ongoing, completed, or terminated. In case a trial is terminated,\nreason for this should be stated. Any unusual, unexpected, or serious adverse drug\nreaction (ADR) detected during a trial should be promptly communicated by the\nsponsor to the Licensing Authority under Rule 21 and the other investigators.\nIn all trials an informed, written consent is required to be obtained from each\nvolunteer/patient in the prescribed form (See Appendix V), which must be signed,\nby the patient/volunteer and the chief investigator.",

Chemical and Pharmaceutical Information\nMost of the data under this heading (See Appendix I to Sch. Y, Item 2) are required\nwith the application for marketing permission. When the application is for clinical\ntrials only, information covered in item 2.1 to 2.3 of Appendix I will usually suffice.\n3. Animal Toxicology\n1. Acute toxicity: Acute toxicity studies (See Appendix I – Sch. Y - Item 4.2) should\nbe carried out in at least two species, usually mice and rats using the same route as\nintended for humans. In addition, at least two more route should be used to ensure\nsystemic absorption of the drug, this route may depend on the nature of the drug.\nMortality should be looked for up to 72 hours after parenteral administration and\nup to 7 days after oral administration. Symptoms, signs and mode of death should\nbe reported, with appropriate macroscopic and microscopic findings where\nnecessary. LD 50s should be reported preferably with 95 percent confidence limits,\nif LD 50s cannot be determined, reasons for this should be stated.\n2. Long-term toxicity: Long-term toxicity studies (see Appendix I – Sch. Y, Item 1.3)\nshould be carried out in at least two mammalian species, of which one should be a\nnon-rodent. The duration of study will depend on whether the application is for\nmarketing permission or for clinical trial, and in the later case, on the phases of\ntrials (see Appendix III).

If a species is known to metabolize the drug in the same\nway as humans, it should be preferred.\nIn long-term toxicity studies the drug should be administered 7 days a week by the\nroute intended for clinical use in humans. The number of animals required for these\nstudies, i.e. the minimum number on which data should be available, is shown in\nAppendix IV to Sch. Y.\nA control group of animals, given the vehicle alone, should always be included,\nand three other groups should be given graded doses of the drug; the highest dose\nshould produce observable toxicity, the lowest dose should not cause observable\ntoxicity, but should be comparable to the intended therapeutic dose in humans or a\nmultiple of it, eg: 2.5x to make allowance for the sensitivity of the species; the\nintermediate dose should cause some symptoms, but not gross toxicity or death,\nand may be placed logarithmically between the other two doses.\nThe variables to be monitored and recorded in long-term toxicity studies include\nbehavioral, physiological, biochemical and microscopic observations.\n3. Reproduction studies: Reproduction studies (see Appendix I – Sch. Y, item 4.4)\nneed to be carried out only if the new drug is proposed to be studied or used in\nwomen of childbearing age. Two species should generally be used, one of them\nbeing non-rodent if possible.\n(a)Fertility studies: The drug should be administered to both males and females, beginning\na sufficient number of days before mating.

Human/Clinical Pharmacology trials (Phase I)\nThe objective of phase I of trials (see Appendix I, Sch. Y, Item 5) is to determine the\nmaximum tolerated dose in humans; pharmacodynamic effects, adverse reactions, if any,\nwith their nature and intensity; and pharmacokinetic behaviors or the drug as far as\npossible. These studies are carried out in healthy adult males, using clinical, physiological\nand biochemical observations. At least 2 subjects should be used on each dose.\nPhase I trials are usually carried out by investigators trained in clinical pharmacology and\nhaving the necessary facilities to closely observe and monitor the subjects.

Normally 10-12 patients should be studied at each dose\nlevel. These studies are usually limited to 3-4 centers and carried out by clinicians\nspecialized on the concerned therapeutic areas and having adequate facilities to perform\nthe necessary investigations for efficacy and safety.\n7. Confirmatory trials (Phase III)\nThe purpose of these trials (see Appendix I to Sch. Y, Item 7) is to obtain sufficient\nevidence about the efficacy and safety of the drug in a larger number of patients, generally\nin comparison with a standard drug and/or a placebo as appropriate. These trials may be\ncarried out by clinicians in the concerned therapeutic areas, having facilities appropriate to\nthe protocol. If the drug is already approved/marketed in other countries, phase III data\nshould generally be obtained on at least 100 patients distributed over 3-4 centres primarily\nto confirm the efficacy and safety of the drug, in Indian patients when used as\nrecommended in the product monograph for the claims made.\nIf the drug is a new drug substance discovered in India and not marketed in any\nother country, phase III data should be obtained on at least 500 patients distributed over\n10-15 centers.

    "text": "Globalization and international standardization also contribute to the fact that companies must comply with frequently\nchanging regulations such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 to prevent balance sheet manipulation, which also affects\nthe IT landscape.\nAs a result, the demands on corporate management are increasing, which requires a correspondingly functional and\nefficient organizational structure. This includes above all IT governance as a decision-making and organizational\nconcept as well as IT compliance for the observance of standards and laws. While the goal of IT governance is to\nestablish a framework that is ideally oriented to international standards such as COBIT or ITIL, compliance aims to\nfulfill the legal and other requirements of IT [2].\nThe interaction of IT governance and IT compliance should therefore be strongly interlinked, at least from a\ntheoretical point of view. In business practice, however, this is often not the case, as there are institutional, process-\nrelated, and personnel coordination problems. We assume that the existence of coordination problems creates gaps\nthat can be exploited by cyber attackers.\nIn this article, the problems of IT governance and IT compliance are extended by a special context: On the one\nhand, we focus on family businesses. Family businesses are of great importance for almost all economies of the world.\nHowever, they have not yet been extensively researched. In addition, the management of family businesses has some\nspecial characteristics, such as the adherence to strong corporate cultures, shared values and beliefs, and not as much\nwriting down as in non-family businesses. This is already a problem when it comes to IT governance and IT\ncompliance.

It is mainly concerned with information security, the availability and storage of data, and data protection.\nThe primary goal of IT compliance is to minimize cyber risks and avoid non-compliance, which has social, fi-nancial\nand legal consequences. [4]\nThere are several frameworks for the implementation and application of IT compliance, which those responsible\ncan use for orientation. The international professional association Information Systems Audit and Control Association\n(ISACA) deals with IT audit, IT risk, and IT governance and developed the framework Control Objectives for\nInformation and Related Technology (COBIT).

[5]\nUnlike COBIT, IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL) does not contain any form templates or implementation rules. The\nstandard for providing IT services is very general and therefore applicable to various industries. ITIL enables\ncompanies to be certified according to ISO 20000 and provides support through customer-specific process\nrecommendations. [6]\nAnother framework is the Information Security Management System (ISMS) according to ISO 27001. The goal of\nan ISMS is to provide and process information to optimize business processes, achieve corporate goals and maintain\nthe value of the company. Concerning trust, integrity, and availability, ISMS guarantees the protection of this\ninformation. The core topics are based on governance, compliance, and risk. [7]\n2.2 Implementation of IT Compliance\nThe implementation of frameworks that support IT governance and IT compliance is very complex. When deciding\non the appropriate standard, the type of company, the business area to be standardized, and the relevant characteristics\nof the standard play a major role. [8] According to a study by Horváth & Partners (2012), 63 percent of the participating\nIT managers use the ITIL standard, 37 percent of COBIT and a total of 27 percent do not use a standard. Multiple\nanswers were possible here. [9]\nThe effort and complexity of the implementation are a result, among other things, of the high demand for skilled\nworkers with the corresponding know-how. [1] Furthermore, the management and the board of directors must be\nsupportive to motivate employees and set an example according to the principle of \"tone from the top\".

After all, a\nhigh degree of employee acceptance is also important for efficient implementation and sustainable success. [1] Of\nparticular importance are also regulations and standards, such as legal norms, regarding data protection or\ntelecommunications, as well as various contracts and internal regulations. [1]\n2.3 Characteristics of family firms\nThe definitions of family business vary widely. For a statistical survey, it is therefore particularly important to\nknow which companies fall within the definition of family firms, otherwise, the results could be falsified. According\nto Shanker/Astrakhan (1996, p. 109), three definitions differ concerning the influence of the family as such: The\ncomprehensive definition describes the family's involvement as small so that only strategic decisions are influenced.\nWithin the middle definition, the founder or descendant runs the company and has legal control. If several generations\nof the family are directly involved in management positions and thus have sovereignty over the management and\nownership of the company, they are included in the narrow definition. [10]\nGeneral differences between family and non-family firms often lie in the lower average amount of turnover and\nconsequently the lower number of employees [11]. Nevertheless, family firms should not be equated with small\nbusinesses, as many large companies are also family-run [12]. Differences can also be seen in the capital structure:\nWhile the shares of non-family firms are usually spread over several shareholders, 79 percent of German family firms",

Differences can also be seen in the capital structure:\nWhile the shares of non-family firms are usually spread over several shareholders, 79 percent of German family firms\nown all shares. Furthermore, the management and the supervisory board are mostly in the hands of the family. This is\npartly because they are often too small to maintain the legal form of a stock corporation, but also because they reject\nexternal management. [11]\nThe probably most important characteristic of a family business is the focus on maintaining so-called socio-\nemotional wealth (SEW) as part of the corporate strategy. Accordingly, family firms often prefer their image to their\nfinancial situation. This is characterized by a high level of identity with the company, which often carries the same\nname as the family itself.

In particular, the tendency towards intuitive decision-making, which is usually less pronounced in non-\nfamily firms, formalized decision and control instruments as well as performance measurement is less used here. [15]\nThe organizational structure also plays an important role. Since the board of directors usually takes on overlapping\nfunctions and no specialists are convened, [15] there is a lack of know-how in certain areas, which makes IT\ncompliance concerning the regulations necessary [16].

In particular, ISO standards, such as ISO 27001, which\ndescribes the principles and requirements for ISMS, are therefore applied too rarely. [17] However, this is also related\nto the fact that the majority of family firms are small and medium-sized enterprises. The high costs involved, the high\nexpenditure of time as well as insufficiently specialized and trained employees represent barriers for smaller family\nbusinesses that are difficult to overcome. [18]\nThe higher the family's share of the company's management, the more difficult it is to recruit qualified employees.\nOne reason for this is that the chances of promotion are low, as the relevant positions have already been filled by the\nfamily. On the other hand, good-skilled workers are less willing to work in family firms because they may demand\nmore decision-making power, which could conflict with the goal of the controlling family. [15]\n3. Hypotheses\nFamily firms often have greater difficulties in implementing and operating intensive IT compliance than non-family\nbusinesses.

Due to the low prioritization, cyber security in family firms is, however, also insufficiently\nstructured from a strategic point of view.\nH2: In family firms, cyber security is less often an integral part of corporate strategy than in non-family firms.\nDue to the challenges of implementing and executing IT governance and IT compliance, family firms often have\nan imbalance between systems. As a result, the interaction between IT governance and IT compliance is inconsistent,\nresulting in information being lost and the extent of the risks not being properly assessed.\nH3: Family Firms have generally less information and more problems identifying the value at risk of cyber threats.\nThe introduction of the standards, which serve as a framework for IT governance and IT compliance, also involves\na great deal of effort.

Methodology\nThe data collection was carried out using a standardized online questionnaire consisting of open and closed\nquestions. A pre-test with several test persons was first conducted to verify the questionnaire. Subsequently, the actual\nsurvey was conducted in the period from October 23 to December 31, 2019. With the help of the Nexis database, the\ne-mail addresses of German companies were randomly selected in advance for this purpose.\nIn total, 14,495 companies were contacted by e-mail, of which 1,612 e-mails could not be delivered. Consequently,\n12,883 companies received the link to the online survey. During the survey period, the online questionnaire was\naccessed 415 times, which corresponds to a participation rate of 3.22 percent. A total of 372 companies answered the\nquestions asked, whereby 188 companies ended the survey before completion (utilization rate: 89.64 percent).\nTherefore, the sample size amounts to 184 companies, and the response rate to 1.43 percent.\nIn this context, it should be noted that individual questions may nevertheless be mentioned differently, as the partial\nnon-response (item non-response) has not been considered in this report. The reason for this is that the questionnaire\nwas consciously designed without specifying mandatory questions, as in some cases very topic-specific and sensitive\ndata was requested. The data then was evaluated by using the tools Microsoft Excel and SPSS.\n5. Variables\n5.1 Independent Variables",

The data then was evaluated by using the tools Microsoft Excel and SPSS.\n5. Variables\n5.1 Independent Variables\nThe independent variable in the study is family influence. There are several operationalizations for this variable in\nthe literature. Since the companies in the survey are primarily small and medium-sized enterprises and family\nbusinesses, which tend to answer less when questions are too complex, a single-item approach was chosen for the\npresent study. To measure family influence, a 0/1 coded question \"Is your company a family business\" was used,\nwhich yields the variable FAMI-LY. Of the 184 companies in the study, 106 are family enterprises and 78 are non-\nfamily enterprises.\n5.2 Dependent Variables\nA different dependent variable was defined for each of the four hypotheses. For H1 the dependent variable is\nPRIO_CYBER. This variable describes the subjective priority of cyber risks in the enterprise. The variable was\nqueried as a single-item variable on a five-level Likert scale with the response alternatives 1=very low to 5=very high.\nFor H2 the dependent variable is IN-TEGR_STRAT. The question here is whether companies integrate\ncybersecurity into their corporate strategy. This variable was measured as a binary 0/1 variable (no/yes).\nFor H3 the dependent variable is NO_VALMETH. The question of whether companies have no evaluation method\nfor cyber risks was also measured as a binary 0/1 variable.

The size of the enterprise - variable SIZE - was operationalized by the number of employees. The\nnumber of employees was surveyed in four classes:\n- SIZE_99: enterprises with up to 99 employees (n=34);\n- SIZE_100_999: enterprises with between 100 and 999 employees (n=122);\n- SIZE_1000_9999: companies with between 1,000 and 9,999 employees (n=17);\n- SIZE_10000: enterprises with 10,000 or more employees (n=4).\nThe class of up to 99 employees was chosen as the reference class.\n2786 Patrick Sven Ulrich et al. / Procedia Computer Science 225 (2023) 2781–2789\n6 Author name / Procedia Computer Science 00 (2023) 000–000\n6.

The assessment that family businesses assign a lower significance to cyber security than non-\nfamily businesses could not be confirmed, at least from the perspective of the survey. The majority of the companies\nshow a high level of awareness of cyber security. The second hypothesis regarding the integration of cyber security\ninto corporate strategy could not be confirmed either. Here, no differences between family and non-family businesses\nare apparent.\nSignificant results are shown for the assessment of cyber risks and the ISMS. Family businesses have less often an\nevaluation metric for such risks, which greatly reduces the success of the defense and correction of the damage. An\nISMS to defend against cyber attacks is also used less often in family businesses than in non-family businesses.\nA closer look at the results reveals the great importance of the size of the company: The larger the company, the\nhigher the priority of cybersecurity and the more likely it is that it will become part of the corporate strategy (see H1\nand H2).

The main reason for this is the insufficient interaction between IT\ngovernance and IT compliance, which leads to regular information losses. An ISMS according to ISO 27001 is not\nsufficiently implemented even in family businesses (H4), so there are often no rules or methods to support the\ninformation security of the company.\nFamily businesses, especially the smaller ones, are therefore very vulnerable to cyber-attacks. Such an attack can\ntake on existential proportions, as the costs, especially for SMEs, can no longer be covered. This problem is becoming\nincreasingly important in the course of digitalization. It is therefore essential to constantly improve the interaction\nbetween IT governance and IT compliance to protect the company as much as possible from cyber threats.\n7.1 Limitations\nLike any other empirical study, our study is subject to some limitations: We conducted the study as a survey and\nsingle-respondent design only limited to Germany in 2019.

Echoing the pioneering views of Brodie [1], data quality is heralded as a vital element across\nthe data lifecycle, transcending basic collection and storage to include ongoing maintenance and assessment through\nthe integration of novel tools and cutting-edge concepts and methodologies. This holistic view ensures data remains\naccurate, trustworthy, and relevant to user needs.\nData quality's role is pivotal, influencing the efficacy of information systems, bolstering user confidence, and\nensuring regulatory compliance. As data becomes increasingly fundamental to business operations and decision-\nmaking, the imperative for maintaining high-quality standards intensifies. Notably, data quality is essential for\nadhering to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which mandates the accuracy and, when necessary, the\ntimeliness of personal data updates. Consequently, data quality management transitions from a best practice to a\nregulatory mandate across various contexts, highlighting its critical importance for organizational functionality.\nHence, GDPR elevates data quality as a key standard for data privacy and security protection, compelling organizations\nto ensure the processed data's precision, currency, and retention only as required for specified purposes [2].\nAs outlined by Balau [3], GDPR necessitates strict adherence to data quality standards by data controllers,",

It is a critical\nsuccess factor for organizations aiming to thrive in the digital age, requiring a holistic approach that integrates\ntechnology, processes, and people. The future of digital innovation and governance will increasingly depend on the\nability of organizations to maintain high standards of data quality, underscoring its importance as a strategic asset in\nthe quest for excellence, security, and compliance in the digital domain.\n294 António Gonçalves et al. / Procedia Computer Science 256 (2025) 292–299\n3.Markovchain and data quality\nMarkov Chains [5], named after the Russian mathematician Andrey Markov, are a class of stochastic processes that\nhave found extensive applications in various fields, from probability theory to computer science and engineering.

The\nessence of these processes lies in the \"memoryless\" property, or Markov property, where the probability of\ntransitioning to the next state depends only on the current state and not on the sequence of events that preceded it.\nMarkov Chains are models used to describe systems that undergo transitions between states with defined\nprobabilities, independent of previous history (the \"memoryless\" property). The \"states\" represent the different\npossible conditions of the system, while the \"transition probabilities\" indicate the chance of moving from one state to\nanother, all summarized in a \"transition matrix.\" Each row of this matrix must sum to 1, representing all possible next\nconditions. The \"time step\" refers to the interval between transitions. The \"initial state distribution\" defines the initial\nprobabilities of each state, and the \"steady-state distribution\" describes the probabilities that the system reaches after\nan extensive number of steps, reflecting the long-term behaviourof the system [5].\nThe application of Markov Chains in data quality management highlights a systematic and predictive approach,\nessential for the development of robust, accurate, and efficient information systems.

Data quality is not just a matter of compliance but also an ethical and practical issue, essential for the\ntrust of data subjects and for the effectiveness of data processing operations.\nUnder the GDPR, data quality is an integral part of data protection from the outset (data protection by design) and\nby default (data protection by default), meaning that appropriate measures must be implemented to ensure that\npersonal data is processed to the highest standard of security and only for the necessary period. Furthermore, data\nsubjects have the right to rectify incorrect or incomplete data[7].\nA personal data breach occurs when there is a security failure that results, unintentionally or unlawfully, in the\ndestruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise\nprocessed.

Poor quality data can lead to inadequate management and\nincorrect application of security measures, increasing the chances of a breach and making the detection and response\nprocess more difficult. Thus, ensuring data quality is fundamental to reducing the possibility of personal data breaches\nand to ensuring compliance with data protectionregulations such as the GDPR.The relationship between data quality\nand personal data breaches is fundamentally as follows [8]: Breach Prevention: The prevention of personal data\nbreaches starts with maintaining high data quality, a premise based on the triad of accuracy, relevance, and security.\nEach of these elements plays a crucial role in mitigating risks associated with data management.

This approach aims to understand how\ndifferent data breach incidents affect compliance and the integrity of personal data.

This underscores the importance of\nprotecting data against unauthorized changes to maintain its accuracy.Purpose Limitation and Data Minimization:\nThese attributes are affected by a smaller proportion of breaches, 26.44% and 20.34% respectively, reflecting types\nof breaches that result in the use or exposure of data beyond what is necessary for the purposes for which they were\ncollected.\nTo convert the distribution of data breach methods into a Markov transition matrix, we will apply a theoretical\nassumption. The assumption we will make is that, after each type of data breach, the next breach could be of any\ntype, distributed according to the relative frequencies observed in the dataset. That is, each type of breach \"transits\"\nto another type (including itself) with a probability corresponding to its relative frequency in the dataset (table 3):\nTable 3.

For example, the high\nprobability (approximately 48.12%) of transition from any GDPR attribute back to \"Integrity and Confidentiality\"\nreflects the dominance of this theme in the dataset's data breach incidents. This suggests that, regardless of the specific\nGDPR attribute initially affected by a breach, there is a significant chance that the next breach will also affect the\nIntegrity and Confidentiality of the data. Widespread Impact on Data Breaches: The model suggests that breaches\naffecting Integrity and Confidentiality have the highest likelihood of occurring after any type of previous breach,\nindicating the widespread nature of data security threats across all categories. This aligns with the reality that many\ndata breaches compromise data security and protection, regardless of the initial cause.Accuracy and Data Transitions:\nTransitions to \"Accuracy\" represent the second highest probability, indicating that many data breaches, in addition to\ncompromising security, may result in inaccurate or manipulated information. This highlights the importance of\nmeasures that ensure data accuracy following a breach, especially in contexts where data are critical for business or\npersonal decisions.Considerations on Purpose Limitation and Data Minimization: While these categories show lower",

This underscores the importance of limiting data use to the original purposes and ensuring that only\nnecessary data are collected andretained.Strategic Implications for Data Protection: The matrix provides a theoretical\nframework for understanding how different types of breaches can affect GDPR data quality attributes.

This systematic and\npredictive approach allows for a detailed understanding of data quality dynamics, essential for making decisions aimed\nat accuracy, reliability, and the efficiency of data systems.\nAdditionally, analysing the relationship between data quality and personal data breaches underscores the\nimportance of maintaining high data quality to prevent breaches, mitigate their impact when they occur, and ensure\ncompliance with GDPR legal obligations. This includes continuous data verification and updating practices, along\nwith comprehensive security measures and effective data management practices to protect against data misuse and\nprivacy violations.\nMoving forward, organizations are recommended to adopt a proactive approach to data quality management,\nimplementing robust data quality policies and utilizing predictive models, like Markov Chains, to anticipate potential\ndata breaches. This approach not only helps prevent data breaches but also strengthens overall GDPR compliance,\nprotects individual privacy, and upholds the integrity and reputation of organizations.\nIn summary, maintaining data quality and implementing predictive methods for managing data security risks are\ncrucial for GDPR compliance and for protecting privacy and personal data security.

Preamble\n1.1 Introduction\nVaccines differ from therapeutic medicines first because of the\nbiological, and thus inherently variable, nature of the products themselves, the\nraw materials used in their production, and the biological methods used to test\nthem. Thus special expertise and procedures are needed for their\nmanufacture, control, and regulation. Vaccines are unique in the fact that they\nare usually administered to very large numbers of healthy people; mostly\ninfants, in national immunization programmes; thus safety and quality are\nparamount.\nIn recent years, the licensing and quality control for manufacturers and\nnational regulatory authorities alike has become even more complex by the\ndevelopment of vaccine formulations containing an increased number of\nimmunogens. Each new vaccine combination needs to be carefully tested\nclinically and testing and specifications may vary for each specific product.\nIn general, all vaccines manufactured / imported into the country are\nrequired to comply with the requirements and guidelines specified in the Drugs\nand Cosmetics Rules, 1945 & New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019 and\nother applicable guidelines published by CDSCO form time to time in case of\nmanufacturer r-DNA derived vaccines the requirements and guidelines",

Policy on Administrative matter\n2.1 Governing Act, Rules and Guidance:\nVaccine is a drug within the meaning of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act,\n1940. The import, manufacture, sale distribution and conduct of the clinical trial\nare regulated under this Act. Vaccine is a “new drug” throughout its lifecycle.\nThe requirements to assess the safety, immunogenicity and efficacy are\nprovided under the New Drugs and Clinical Trials, 2019 (NDCT Rules).\nFurther, the applications and approvals for obtaining permissions to import,\nmanufacture and conduct of clinical trials are issued under these rules.\nThe Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945 regulate the manufacture or\nimport of vaccines once safety, immunogenicity and efficacy is established\nunder the NDCT rules. Manufacture/import license is issued under these rules.\nCDSCO also issued various guidance documents for the approval of\nvaccines, conduct of clinical trials etc. These guidance are revised from time\nto time. The current applicable guidance documents are available on the\nwebsite of the CDSCO.\n2.2 Role of CDSCO and the State Drug Authorities\nVaccine is a drug within the meaning of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940\n(herein after referred as Act). Import or manufacture for sale of vaccines are\nregulated under the Act, Drugs& cosmetics Rules, 1945 and New Drugs and\nClinical Trials Rules, 2019.

Usually there is no chronic\nexposure of the subject to a vaccine through repeated administration.\nWhere different routes of administration are proposed, multiple safety and\ntoxicity studies in a suitable animal model should be considered. These\nshould address the specific safety concerns associated with administration\nof the vaccine by each of the proposed routes.\n4.1.2 Immunogenicity:\n12\nData obtained from the immunization of animals with candidate vaccine\npreparations shall provide valuable information to support a clinical\nindication.\nPreclinical studies should be designed to assess the relevant immune\nresponses, e.g. seroconversion rates, geometric mean antibody titres, or\ncell-mediated immunity in vaccinated animals. Immunogenicity studies\nmay include the characterization of antibody class, avidity, affinity, half-\nlife, memory, and potential induction of cell-mediated immunity as well as\nrelease of soluble mediators affecting the immune system, as appropriate.\nAnimal toxicity data generated in other countries may be accepted and\nmay not be asked to be repeated or duplicated in India on a case to case",
